            <p>Each sub-team is led by two student co-captains, who are experienced in their respective field. (We also have a wonderful safety captain who makes sure everyone always wears safety glasses!  From this pool of student captains, a head captain is elected by the captains and serves as the primary organizer for internal team affairs (planning meetings, approving projects, etc.) We also can’t forget our mentors, who are absolutely vital to the survival of our team! A huge-thank you to y’all for taking care of logistics like competition registrations and travel expenses. We wouldn’t be where we are without our mentors.</p>
